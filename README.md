##TLDR: My university's gym-mandated appointments during COVID-19 Pandemic. Spots were competitive. This bot sniped the appointments. 

# Overview
In the fall of 2021, Fordham University students were permitted back on campus even though there were no in-person classes held. My roommates and I were so desperate to get back to school that we would rather do our schooling in a three-bed, one-room, holding cell (which, oh by the way, used to be where the medicine students operated on cadavers) than stay home any longer. 

At least the gym was open, but if you wanted to go had to make an appointment and the slots were limited to 25ish people at a time. Appointment slots for the next day became available at noon and they filled up quickly. Here is where this project comes in.

# Situation (functional spec)

Nicole, like me, was a Fordham University student who decided that going to the gym was a non-negotiable. However, she had class four days a week from 11:30am-12:45pm, right when the appointments went live. By the time she was out of class, she could maybe get an 8 pm slot, but that just gave her too much time to sit around and think of an excuse not to go. This project solved her problem, she just has to input her username and password in the script, set her preferred time and leave for class. Now, when she looks at her phone after class she sees an email from the scheduling website confirming her gym time, 9:30 am, just enough time to workout and starbz (starbucks) before class.

# Did it work?

Hell yes. This was an incredibly rewarding project because at the end of the day, it worked. It was janky, it was stanky, but it was the first time I coded in Python. Soon enough, my friends were asking to schedule their appointments, and I had 5-6 scripts scheduled for each person in cron. The total runtime was 15-20 seconds. I thought this would be too slow but as it turns out, it takes a human doing it as fast as they can over 55 seconds to navigate through the several screens and fill out the form. My bot beat them. every. time. 

# Reflections
I would keep much better documentation. I know at one point I had a video of it running, but it was lost to the ether somehow and I desperately want it back. Even now, this readme is being written 2+ years after the script was retired and it should have been done then. This project was so long ago that I'm sure if you asked me then what I would change when I made it I would have a lot more to say, but now I look back on it with nothing but fond memories.
